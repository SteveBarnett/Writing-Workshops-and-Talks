# Writing, Workshops, and Talks

Some notes on presenting ideas. Make it...

- **Social**
    - Connect everyone by showing shared experiences, especially struggles and failures.
    - Work in groups and pairs.
    - Use pair share / teach back activities, have accountability buddies.
- **Physical**
    - Get them moving. Use activities like show of hands, walk around the room.
    - Have breaks that involved leaving the table.
    - Link concepts with movements to increase recall and attention.
- **Positive**
    - Have a physical environment that's not classroom-like.
    - Promote empathy, kindness, perspective, compassion.
    - Use love and charm, not guilt and blame. Positive emotions greatly improve learning (and negative ones hinder).
- **Relevant**
    - Put the why before the what.
    - Have clear, meaningful, relevant, goals.
    - Have outcomes-based actions with observable impact.
- **Identity-based**
    - Connect to the past and the familiar, things and truths they already know.
    - Highlight the values and beliefs that make it important, since they guide behaviour.
    - Find things that are widely relevant, not locally specific.
- **Looped**
    - Frame changes as experiments (that are safe to fail).
    - Focus on effort and progress (not ability or setbacks)
    - → (Re)trial → Feedback → Reflection ↵
- **Emotional**
    - Use an emotional argument. Entertain and excite to overcome indifference, disinterest, apathy.
    - Use human-scale stats or vivid details. Show a big, emotional, display of the problem. Bring reality into the room.
    - Show before and after to motivate the change.
- **Short**
    - Keep it simple and prioritise. What's the key message or concept?
    - Make small but meaningful milestones. Find the short-term reward linked to the long-term benefit.
    - Do warm-ups, easier or softer, stuff before the difficult stuff.
- **High energy**
    - Have a strong opening.
    - Have a strong peak.
    - Have a strong closing.
- **Flexible**
    - Vary type and length of activities, senses used.
    - Have a responsive curriculum (modular, chosen by learner)
    - Recognise and accept diversity.
- **Concrete**
    - Have integrity: be the example.
    - Use concrete examples to help focus. Use images. Look at good examples and analyse why they're good.
    - Positive Injunctive > Negative Informational.
- **Questioning**
    - Ask questions rather than give answers. Provide a curiosity gap.
    - Let people draw their own conclusions, discover the answers themselves.
    - Promote a growth mindset, not a fixed mindset.
- **Structured**
    - Have something to complete or fill in.
    - Frame it. Have an agenda, outline, overview.
    - Pull the whole thing together with a narrative.
- **Practical**
    - Show how to get started with small wins that stack up and lead to big ones.
    - Do the work. Tell learners to bring their stuff.
    - Provide a toolkit with clear, actionable, steps.
- **Empathetic**
    - Understand why the change is difficult and frustrating. It takes time and needs supports.
    - Understand both sides. The pros and cons.
    - Make the change sufficiently alluring.
- **Nudging**
  - Use anchoring
  - Use loss aversion
  - Use availability bias
  - Use mere measurement effect (ask, for details)
- **Entrenched**
  - Make it repeatable, regular, ritual.
  - Help them establish habits.
  - Make concrete plans. Use WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) or 5Ws and 1H.
