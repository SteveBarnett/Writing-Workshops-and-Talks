# Writing, Workshops, and Talks

Some notes on presenting ideas. Make it...

- **Social**
    - Work in groups and pairs. Use pair share / teach back activities.
    - Connect with them by showing shared experiences, especially struggles and failures.
    - Connect them with each other by showing shared experiences.
- **Physical**
    - Get them moving. Use activities like show of hands, walk around the room.
    - Have breaks that involved leaving the table.
    - Link concepts with movements to increase recall and attention.
- **Positive**
    - Have a physical environment that's not classroom-like.
    - Promote empathy, kindness, perspective, compassion.
    - Use love and charm, not guilt and blame. Positive emotions greatly improve learning (and negative ones hinder).
- **Relevant**
    - Put the why before the what.
    - Have clear, meaningful, relevant, goals.
    - Have outcomes-based actions with observable impact.
- **Identity-based**
    - Connect to the past and the familiar, things and truths they already know.
    - Highlight the values and beliefs (that guide behaviour) that make it important.
    - Find things that are universally relevant, not locally specific.
- **Experimental**
    - Make it safe to fail and try again.
    - (Re)trial → Feedback → Reflection
    - Frame changes as experiments.
- **Emotional**
    - Use an emotional argument. Entertain and excite to overcome indifference, disinterest, apathy.
    - Use human-scale stats or vivid details. Show a big, emotional, display of the problem. Bring reality into the room.
    - Show before and after to motivate the change.
- **Short**
    - Keep it simple and prioritise. What's the key message or concept?
    - Make small but meaningful milestones. Find the short-term reward linked to the long-term benefit.
    - Do warm-ups, easier or softer, stuff before the difficult stuff.
- **High energy**
    - Have a strong opening.
    - Have a strong peak.
    - Have a strong closing.
- **Varied**
    - Vary type and length of activities.
    - Plan regular breaks.
    - Hook into multiple types of memory.
- **Concrete**
    - Have integrity. Be the example.
    - Use concrete examples to help focus. Look at good examples and analyse why they're good.
    - Use images, metaphors, mental pictures, concrete ideas.
- **Questioning**
    - Ask questions rather than give answers. Provide a curiosity gap.
    - Let people draw their own conclusions, discover the answers themselves.
    - Promote a growth mindset, not a fixed mindset.
- **Structured**
    - Have something to complete or fill in.
    - Frame it. Have an agenda, outline, overview.
    - Pull the whole thing together with a narrative.
- **Do-able**
    - Show how to get started with small wins that stack up and lead to big ones.
    - Provide a toolkit with actionable steps. Be clear on what to do next.
    - Make it repeatable, regular, ritual.
- **Empathetic**
    - Understand why the change is difficult and frustrating. It takes time and needs supports.
    - Understand both sides. The pros and cons.
    - Make the change sufficiently alluring.
