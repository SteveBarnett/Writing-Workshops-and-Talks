# Writing, Workshops, and Talks

Some notes on presenting ideas.

## A, B, C

- **Asking:** the statement or action you're asking for.
- **Becausing:** the data and facts that explain why.
- **Convincing:** the response to anticipated challenges.

## Theoretical

- **Use an emotional argument**, but don't get angry. Use love and charm, not guilt and blame. Promote empathy, kindness, perspective.
- **Entertain and excite** to overcome indifference, disinterest, and apathy. This is especially important for uncomfortable, serious, truths. The more significant the thing, the more nervous we get. Use a narrative to pull the points together.
- **Connect to the past and the familiar**. Help make and find connections to things and truths that people already know.
- **Connect with the audience by showing your shared experiences**, especially mistakes you've made.
- Find things that are **universally relevant, not locally specific**.
- **Understand the benefits of both sides**: show the pros and cons. **Understand why the change is difficult and frustrating**, even when we know the right thing to do.
- **Focus on what people want**, not what they need, as an entry point. Find the **short-term reward** that's linked to the the long-term benefit.

## Practical

- **Have integrity**. Be the example.
- **Make it social**. Have people pair up and work in groups.
- **Use concrete examples** to help focus empathy and compassion. Look at good examples and analyse why they're good. Look at them from different angles.
- **Ask questions rather than give answers**.
- **Make it safe to fail**, and try again. Explain how it shows they're at the edge of their knowledge and are learning new things.
- **Provide a toolkit with actionable steps**. We learn by doing, by immediately applying what we learned. Show how to get started with small wins / successes that will lead to big ones.
- **Make it repeatable, regular, and ritual** for the future. It helps the learning stick and have a lasting effect.
