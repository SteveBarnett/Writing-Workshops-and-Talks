# Writing, Workshops, and Talks

Some notes on presenting ideas.

## A, B, C

- **Asking:** the statement or action you're asking for.
- **Becausing:** the data and facts that explain why.
- **Convincing:** the response to anticipated challenges.

## Theoretical

1. **Use an emotional argument**, but don't get angry. Use love and charm, not guilt and blame. Promote empathy, kindness, perspective. **Entertain and excite**, especially for uncomfortable, serious, truths. The more significant the thing, the more nervous we get.
- **Connect to the past and the familiar**. Help make and find connections to things / truths people already know.  Find things that are **universally relevant, not locally specific**.
- **Understand the benefits of both sides**: show the pros and cons. **Understand why the change is difficult and frustrating**, even when we know the right thing to do.

## Practical

1. **Have integrity**. Be the example.
- **Provide a toolkit with actionable steps**: we learn by doing. Show how to get started with small wins / successes that will lead to big ones. Make it repeatable, regular, and ritual to help the learning stick and have a lasting effect.
- **Use concrete examples** to help focus empathy and compassion. Look at good examples and analyse why they're good.
